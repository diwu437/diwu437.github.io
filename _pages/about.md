# Career experience

My name is Di Wu. I graduated from University of Washington in 2019 with a bachelor’s degree of Economics. During my undergraduate years, I had struggling to find what is my true passion. After participating in multiple internship program such as Citi Bank and Mckinsey, I start to realize the power of Data. 

Now I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics at University of Rochester, where I received solid training in data analytic related skills including Machine Learning, Statics, programming and data visualization.
I am proficient at developing machine learning model including hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. I am also good at explanatory data analysis as well as data extraction, data mining, data cleaning and feature engineering.  

During my free time, I have applied my skill set to several internships. I was working for a fashion designer named Parisa Wang where I leverage on python to web scraping competitors’ product attributes in order to positing our product and co-worked with UI/UX and Digital Marketing department to optimize our SEO. I have also worked for a classic music education organization in New York where I collocated with two other consultants to support an entire launching project lifecycle from planning, design to implementation and finally launch. During those internships, I have not only enhanced my technical skills, but also my communicating and presenting skills. I have also learned how to build rapport with clients and managers. 

At the end of day, all the efforts are worth it!

# Hobbies
### Traveling 
Besides sports, I also like to travel around the world. Over the past years, I have been to a lot of amazing places that make a deep impression on me. The distant and dreamy snow mountain in Switzerland; the boundless and superb grassland in Mongolia; the brilliantly blue and unfrozen Baikal in Russian; the tasty and juicy fruits in Bali, everything was unique and unforgettable. Cannot wait to explore more in the future!

### Sports
I like to play sports after school and work. Like most kids in high school, being good at basketball has always been my goal throughout my four years of high school. I used to play for my high school basketball team for two years as well as the volleyball team for 1 year. I also like to play soccer for fun.

### Bodybuilding

First two years of college had almost put on 30 pounds on my belly. One day, I decide to start change my life and start lifting weights. However, as I become better and better, the satisfaction of making each small progress on my body makes me fall in love with it. It has been two years from now since I start to learn about bodybuilding, and it gradually becomes part of my life. It has a huge positive impact on my lifestyle both physically and mentally. Not only grants me a better body and healthier lifestyle, it also makes me more self-discipline and unremitting.
