# Career experience

My name is Di Wu. In 2019, I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor’s degree in Economics. My undergraduate years were marked by a struggle to find my true calling. After participating in various internship programs and courses, the power of data attracted propel me to pursue more advanced education in the field of data analytic.  
Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of Rochester, where I received solid training in data analytic related skills, including Machine Learning, Statics, Programming and Data Visualization. Over the past year at Simon, I used my skills and knowledge to successfully undertake several additional internships. In particular, I worked for a fashion designer named Parisa Wang, where I leveraged on python to web scraping competitors’ product attributes in order to posit our product. I co-worked with UI/UX and Digital Marketing Department to optimize our SEO. I also worked for New York classical music education organization, where I collaborated with two other consultants to web-scrap comments of various online platform and leverage on Natural language Process technique to choose the platform for our live streaming courses. These hands on experience not only to enhance my technical skills, but also give me a better sense of how real life work is differnet from school projects. At the end of the day, all the efforts are worth it!

# Hobbies
### Traveling 

Traveling has always been my favorite way to enlarge my vision and relax. Over the past years, I visited a number of amazing places, which had had a deep impression on me. I went to the distant and dreamy, snow mountain in Switzerland. I marveled at superb, boundless grassland in Mongolia. I observed a brilliant, blue, unfrozen Baikal Lake in Russia. I tasted exotic, juicy fruits in Bali. Every single traveling experience was unique and unforgettable for me and I cannot wait to explore more in the future!

### Sports & Gym
During my free time. I like to play basketball and workout at the gym. I used to play for my high school basketball team for two years and our team finished 5th in the state highschool basketball league in the second year.  I can still remember how hard everyone worked to fight for the honor. It was a precious experience in my life. 
Other than playing basketball, I like to workout after work. It has been two years from now since I start to learn about bodybuilding, and it gradually becomes part of my life. It has a huge positive impact on my lifestyle both physically and mentally. Not only grants me a better body and healthier lifestyle, it also makes me more self-discipline and unremitting.
