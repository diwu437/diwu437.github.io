Introduction
In this project, I use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. Furthermore, I will analyze top factors that influence user retention.Â 
I have transformed gender and geography varibles to binary varibles to enhance model performance. And then i have standardized features for the same purpose.
Based on the Accuracy socre, i picked Logistic regression as my final model with its best hyperparameters.
Identified Age as the primary facotr that effect churn rate based on feature importance.
