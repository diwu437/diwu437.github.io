In this project, we are supposed to do the profit maximization with multi-segment and
multi-product for the sake of analyzing the best pricing strategy for the new product
“Kiwi Bubbles”. Under the assumption that the unit costs are all $0.5 and market size is
1000 consumers, the data set we had records the choices of soft drink of 359
consumers over the course of 3 years. More details about how we manipulated the logit
model are as follows.
